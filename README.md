This project demonstrates the implementation of a thread pool server in Java. It covers the concepts of sockets for client-server communication, multithreading, and using a thread pool to handle multiple client requests efficiently.

Features
Client-Server Communication: Utilizes sockets to establish communication between clients and the server.
Multithreading: Uses a thread pool to handle multiple client connections concurrently.
Efficient Resource Management: Manages threads efficiently with a thread pool, reducing the overhead of creating and destroying threads for each client request.

Technologies Used
Java
Sockets (TCP/HTTP)
Multithreading
Thread Pool
